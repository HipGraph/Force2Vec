This is the README file for kernel generator. If you want to generate kernels
to calculate attractive and repulsive forces based on t-distribution and/or 
sigmoid, you can use this generator. 

Make variables: 

force = [t,s] : to generate kernel based on t-distribution, use make force=t
                to generate kernel based on sigmoid, use make force=s

vlen = [D]    : to set SIMD width, use vlen. Please see simd.h file to get 
                different values of vlen on different architecture. 
dim = [D]     : to set dimension,  use dim and it should be multiple of vlen. 
pre = [s,d]   : to set precision of the kernel as single precision floating point
                use pre=s. For double precision, use pre=d  

Please note that you will need simd.h file to compile these kernels. It is a 
wrapper and contains all system specific implementations.
